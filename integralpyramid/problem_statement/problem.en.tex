\problemname{Integral Pyramid}

Pascal's triangle is a marvel of the combinatorical world, and what's more you
can easily build one for yourself at home.

The lowest row has $n$ numbers. The next row is staggered and has $n-1$ numbers,
where the $i$th is the sum of the $i$th and the $i+1$th on the previous row.

You can choose any positive integers for the lowest row, but the single cell on
the top row needs to be equal to a given $x$. Is this possible?

\section*{Input}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The only line contains the number of rows, $n$ ($1 \le n \le 20$),
        and the value needed at the top, $x$ ($1 \le x \le 10^9$).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Output}

If a pyramid can be constructed, output all of the numbers on each row, starting
from the top. Every number must be greater than or equal to $1$.

Otherwise, output \texttt{impossible}.
