Integral Pyramid

Pascal's triangle is a marvel of the combinatorical world, and what's more you
can easily build one for yourself at home.

The lowest row has  numbers. The next row is staggered and has  numbers,
where the th is the sum of the th and the th on the previous row.

You can choose any positive integers for the lowest row, but the single cell on
the top row needs to be equal to a given . Is this possible?

Input

itemize
  The only line contains the number of rows,  (),
        and the value needed at the top,  ().
itemize

Output

If a pyramid can be constructed, output all of the numbers on each row, starting
from the top. Every number must be greater than or equal to .

Otherwise, output impossible.
