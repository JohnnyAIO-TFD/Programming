Crooked Dealing

This week you started a flashy new job in Leeds as a poker dealer. Your task
will be to hand out the cards for games. The base pay is not particularly good,
but you found out that you can earn a lot from tips if you deal the cards well.

The most generous customers prefer that their opponents at the table don't
receive any pairs of cards with the same number; so to keep them happy you will
make sure this never happens.

You already know the numbers on every card in the pile , and the number of
cards any player must have in their hand. Find how many hands you can make at
once without introducing a pair.
