Hat Stand

You own several hats, some of which you wear more than others. Because wearing
all  at once would be impractical, you store the spares on a rack with 
hooks. The first hook is a half metre from the door, the second one metre, the
third a metre-and-a-half, and so on. This means that walking from and to the
door to the th hook involves  metres of walking.

Tonight you will need to make a series of public appearances, each time wearing
headgear appropriate to the role. When you come back from one engagement, you
will take the hat you need from its hook and exchange it with the one you had
been wearing before. This means that hats can move around as the night goes on.

Given the plan for tonight, and assuming you are already wearing the first one,
what is the best way to arrange the hats on the rack before setting off so as
to minimise the number of metres walked?

Input

itemize
  The first line of input contains two integers:  and 
        (), the number of hats in total and
        the length of the itinerary respectively.
  The second line of input contains  integers: 
        (), the order of hats you need to put
        on. You are already wearing the first one, and you never need to wear
        the same hat twice consecutively.

Output

Output the minimum number of metres you need to walk, once you have optimised
your hat rack.

Next, output  integers: an initial ordering of the hat rack that gives
minimum walking distance, starting from place . This should include exactly
once every hat except the first.

If there are multiple correct answers, you may output any one of them.
