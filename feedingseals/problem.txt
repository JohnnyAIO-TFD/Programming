Feeding Seals

You are in charge of feeding the seals in the Welsh Mountain Zoo. This involves
purchasing buckets of fish and allocating them to volunteers to trek into the
enclosure and distribute fairly to the blubbery residents.

The buckets of fish are already set out. Each volunteer can be assigned to
carry either one or two of these buckets, as long as the combined weight of the
buckets is small enough.

How many volunteers will you need to distribute all of the fish in one trip?
