Knocked Ink

You knocked over the inkwell for the team fountain pen... Now spots of ink are
beginning to form on the page and spread out. This is really going to hamper
your speed at writing up programming contest solutions.

The ink spreads out by forming infinitesimally-small blots on the page. A blot
that appears at time  seconds after the incident grows in radius smoothly,
at a rate of cm per second, and may eventually overlap with other blots on
the page.

At first the page is still usable, but when the combined size of the ink blots
grows large enough, you will have to abandon your work and find another piece
of paper upon which to type up solutions.

How long will it take for this to happen?

Input

The input consists of:
itemize
  one line with the number of inkblots,  (), and the
        real-valued total area of ink in square centimetres at which the paper
        must be abandoned,  ().
   further lines, each with the  and  coordinates in centimetres
        of an ink blot () and the time in seconds at
        which the blot first appears,  ().
itemize

Output

Output the time in seconds at which the ink blots cover exactly  square
centimetres of the infinitely-large page.
Your answer must be accurate to an absolute or relative error of .
